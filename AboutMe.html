        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
  
        <p><div class="myDiv"> I am Ricardo Collie from Columbus, Mississippi. As shown above, I am an alumni of Mississippi State University.  After college, 
        in 2013, I decided to join the miliatry. After training in Texas, I PCS'd to Colorado Springs, CO. In 2014 and 2017 I deployed to Kuwait and Saudia Arabia. 
        In 2016, I was featured in a <a href="https://youtu.be/l6XQ4Hh8Fxc" target="_blank"> video </a> for the Airmen's Magazine at my previous duty station in Colorado Springs 
        (Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station). In 2018, I decided to enroll into the computer programming technology program at Southwestern College.  I will be graduating
        soon and I will look forward to pursuing a Master's degree. After my military stint I hope to become a programmer/developer.</div></p><br>
